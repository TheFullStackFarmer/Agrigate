# Agrigate API

Agrigate has a single API that interacts with the various services that make up
the platform. When running via docker-compose, the API can be accessed on port 8080.

In an effort to make API documentation easier, there is a
[Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) collection in the `bruno/Agrigate` directory.
You also have the option to utilize swagger by navigating to
http://localhost:8080/swagger.
